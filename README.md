# youtube data analysis project
>the latest commit has changed the project a lot, although the backend logic remains the same, the front end of the project looks very refined now
****
- **Streamlit App** use streamlit app directory to access the latest project built using vanilla python instead of ipython and using streamlit library
- **Jupter_EDA**: this folder contains the `.ipynb` files of the previous version using panel, which I still recommend for EDA purpose
